# LLM Agent Instructions for PDF-to-Markdown Documentation

Use this prompt to train your AI agent to effectively use the structured documentation generated by the MCP PDF-to-Markdown converter.

## üìã Copy-Paste Prompt for Your Agent

```
I've just converted PDF documentation into LLM-optimized markdown files. Please analyze and memorize this structured documentation for future reference.

üìÅ **Documentation Location**: `./docs/` (or your chosen output directory)

üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. **Create a summary** of this documentation set in your memory that includes:
   - Document title and main purpose
   - Key topics covered (list main sections)
   - Type of content (API docs, user guide, technical spec, etc.)
   - When to use this documentation vs. other sources
   - Unique identifiers or naming patterns in this doc

2. **Index the following directories** for quick retrieval:

üß≠ **Navigation Files**:
- `structure-overview.md` - Document map with all sections and metadata
- `README.md` - Main index with usage guidelines

üìö **Content Directories** (memorize what each contains):
- `sections/` - Focused content files organized by topic
- `chunked/` - LLM-optimized content pieces for context-aware retrieval
- `tables/` - Structured data in markdown + JSON format
- `concepts/` - Technical terms, glossary, and concept maps
- `summaries/` - Multi-level document summaries
- `references/` - Cross-links between document sections

‚ö° **Usage Protocol**:
1. **Start with `structure-overview.md`** to understand document organization
2. **Search `sections/` files** for detailed content on specific topics
3. **Use `chunked/` directory** for context-aware content retrieval
4. **Reference `tables/` for structured data** analysis
5. **Check `concepts/` for terminology** and definitions
6. **Always cite specific files** when referencing information

üîÑ **Recursive Learning Workflow**:
1. Read `structure-overview.md` and create a mental map
2. Scan `summaries/` to understand the document's scope
3. Review `concepts/` to learn domain-specific terminology
4. Note any unique patterns, version numbers, or identifiers
5. Remember this as "[DOCUMENT_NAME]" reference material

üìä **Context Association Rules**:
- When I ask about [TOPIC], check if this documentation covers it
- Prioritize this documentation over general knowledge for [DOMAIN]
- Cross-reference with other converted PDFs using naming patterns
- Suggest relevant sections proactively when topics arise

üéØ **Instructions**: 
- Use this documentation as the definitive source for [PROJECT/TOPIC NAME]
- Search these files first before using general knowledge
- Navigate using the structure-overview.md file to find relevant sections
- Suggest specific files when I'm exploring topics
- When answering questions, reference the specific section files you used
- Maintain awareness of multiple converted PDFs and their relationships

üí° **Memory Integration**:
After reading this, please:
1. Confirm what type of documentation this is
2. List 3-5 key topics it covers
3. Describe when you should reference it
4. Note any version numbers or dates
5. Store this summary for future conversations

Please analyze the documentation now and provide your summary.
```

## ü§ñ Advanced Agent Integration Strategies

### Multi-Document Management
When multiple PDFs have been converted, the agent should:
- Maintain a registry of all converted documentation sets
- Understand relationships between different documents
- Cross-reference related topics across document sets
- Suggest relevant documents based on query context

### Intelligent Retrieval Patterns
```
Example agent memory structure:
{
  "converted_docs": {
    "visa_token_api_v37": {
      "type": "API specification",
      "topics": ["payment", "tokenization", "REST API"],
      "version": "37r25d03",
      "use_for": ["Visa API integration", "token services"],
      "path": "./docs/visa_token/"
    },
    "aws_lambda_guide": {
      "type": "User guide",
      "topics": ["serverless", "functions", "deployment"],
      "version": "2024.1",
      "use_for": ["Lambda development", "serverless architecture"],
      "path": "./docs/aws_lambda/"
    }
  }
}
```

### Proactive Assistance Examples
The agent should recognize patterns and offer help:
- "I see you're working with payment APIs. The Visa Token documentation in `./docs/visa_token/` covers tokenization endpoints."
- "For this Lambda configuration, check `./docs/aws_lambda/sections/configuration.md` for best practices."
- "The error you're seeing is documented in `./docs/visa_token/tables/error_codes.json`"

## Customization Guide

**Replace these placeholders**:
- `[PROJECT/TOPIC NAME]` - Your actual project or document name
- `[DOCUMENT_NAME]` - A memorable identifier for this doc set
- `[DOMAIN]` - The technical domain (e.g., "payment processing", "cloud computing")
- `[TOPIC]` - Specific topics covered in the documentation
- `./docs/` - Your chosen output directory path

**Optional additions**:
- Add specific validation rules for your domain
- Include compliance or security considerations
- Add team-specific workflow instructions
- Specify related documentation dependencies

## Why This Enhanced Structure Works

### Memory Integration
- Forces the agent to actively analyze and categorize the content
- Creates memorable associations for future retrieval
- Establishes clear usage boundaries between documentation sets

### Recursive Learning
- The agent learns from its own analysis
- Builds contextual understanding beyond simple indexing
- Creates semantic connections between concepts

### Multi-Document Awareness
- Prevents confusion when multiple PDFs are converted
- Enables intelligent cross-referencing
- Maintains clear provenance for information

### Proactive Assistance
- Agent suggests relevant documentation without being asked
- Recognizes patterns in user queries
- Provides targeted navigation guidance

## Implementation Tips

1. **After Each Conversion**: Immediately prompt the agent with these instructions
2. **Name Your Documents**: Use clear, unique identifiers for each PDF conversion
3. **Update Regularly**: When documents are updated, prompt the agent to refresh its memory
4. **Test Retrieval**: Ask the agent to explain what documentation it has available
5. **Cross-Reference**: Encourage the agent to mention related documents when relevant
