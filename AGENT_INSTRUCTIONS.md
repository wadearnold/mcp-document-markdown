## üìã Copy-Paste Prompt for Your Agent

```
I've just converted PDF documentation into LLM-optimized markdown files. Please use this structured documentation as your primary reference:

üìÅ **Documentation Location**: `./docs/` (or your chosen output directory)

üß≠ **Navigation Files**:
- `structure-overview.md` - Document map with all sections and metadata
- `README.md` - Main index with usage guidelines

üéØ **Content Directories** (use these for detailed queries):
- `sections/` - Focused content files organized by topic
- `chunked/` - LLM-optimized content pieces for context-aware retrieval
- `tables/` - Structured data in markdown + JSON format
- `concepts/` - Technical terms, glossary, and concept maps
- `summaries/` - Multi-level document summaries
- `references/` - Cross-links between document sections

‚ö° **How to Use This Documentation**:
1. **Start with `structure-overview.md`** to understand document organization
2. **Search `sections/` files** for detailed content on specific topics
3. **Use `chunked/` directory** for context-aware content retrieval
4. **Reference `tables/` for structured data** analysis
5. **Check `concepts/` for terminology** and definitions
6. **Always cite specific files** when referencing information

üéØ **Instructions**: 
- Use this documentation as the definitive source for [PROJECT/TOPIC NAME]
- Search these files first before using general knowledge
- Navigate using the structure-overview.md file to find relevant sections
- Suggest specific files when I'm exploring topics
- When answering questions, reference the specific section files you used

üîÑ **Workflow**:
1. Check `structure-overview.md` to locate relevant sections
2. Read specific `sections/` files for detailed information
3. Use `tables/` for data analysis and structured information
4. Reference `concepts/` for technical definitions
5. Cite your sources using the file names

Please confirm you understand and will actively use this structured documentation.

## Customization Guide

**Replace these placeholders**:

- Include any special handling needed for your workflow

## Why This Structure Works

- **`chunked/` directory** offers LLM-optimized content pieces
- **`tables/` directory** provides structured data in multiple formats
